<p>Responsive Design is about making websites interface look good and user friendly on all screen sizes and platforms based on the environment of the platform, platforms like a laptop, phone, and pads.this is done by the website automatically adjusting the placement, the design, and the size of the content to fit the platform.this is achieved through fluid proportion-based grids, flexible images,css3 media queries.
</p>

<p>responsive design relates to web technologies because for companies to reach a wider audience and be more profitable, they need the design to be mostly the same for most platforms to maintain an identity and consistent interface so the customer can use it without being confused but different enough to be user friendly because different platforms interacted differently. other positives are that pictures can contain their resolution and quality when going to different web pages with different screen sizes. using the same web page instead of creating two can lower cost and time.

<p>the platform I used was my laptop and the techniques I used were the meta tag, I used the tag to fit the web page dimensions, max-width to control how wide images can be, response text size so the text can follow the size of the browser window and Media Queries so the webpage adjusts according on the size of the window. I learned if a website does not have a responsive web design Google will penalize for having a bad IU experience. the first website that adapts to the browser width was Audi.
